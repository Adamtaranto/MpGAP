MpGAP - A generic multi-platform genome assembly pipeline
=========================================================

`MpGAP <https://github.com/fmalmeida/mpgap>`_ is a pipeline developed with `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html>`_
and `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_. It was designed to provide an easy-to-use framework for genome assembly of Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore
sequencing data through illumina only, long reads only or hybrid modes.

It wraps up the following tools:

* `Canu <https://github.com/marbl/canu>`_
* `Flye <https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye>`_
* `Raven <https://github.com/lbcb-sci/raven>`_
* `Haslr <https://github.com/vpc-ccg/haslr>`_
* `Unicycler <https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler>`_
* `SPAdes <https://github.com/ablab/spades>`_
* `Shovill <https://github.com/tseemann/shovill>`_
* `Nanopolish <https://github.com/jts/nanopolish>`_
* `Medaka <https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka>`_
* `Quast <https://github.com/ablab/quast>`_
* `GenomicConsensus <https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus>`_
* `Pilon <https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon>`_
