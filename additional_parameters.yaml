# This file will be used to set additional parameters besides the required ondes that will be
# configurable just from the "*.config" file. The user must be aware that some additional
# parameters may cause the pipeline to crash since it may stop producing an specif file that
# is required. For example, if the user set the spades software to only run the correction step
# the pipeline will crash since it expects an assembly file.
#
# It is utterly important that the user never change sintax of the keys written here because it
# will cause the pipeline to not correct understand the additional parameters.
#
# Integers should be without quotes, string inside quotes, and booleans as True or False.

# It is possible for one add more parameters not included if one pay attention to the pattern here
# used. ([key]: [value] will become --key value for Spades and Unicycler and key value for Canu. If
# the value is not a boolean)
#
# Do not, in any circumstances, add a parameter that needs a file, since nextflow needs to create file
# channels so they can be accessible in processes, this would require a massive alteration of the pipeline
# code.
