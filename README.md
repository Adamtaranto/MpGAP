MpGAP is is an easy to use nextflow docker-based pipeline that adopts well known software for genome assembly of Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data through illumina only, long reads only or hybrid modes. This pipeline wraps up the following software:

* [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu)
* [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye)
* [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler)
* [Spades](https://github.com/ablab/spades)
* [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish)
* [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka)
* [GenomicConsensus](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus)
* [Pilon](https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon)
* [QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast)

## Further reading

This pipeline has two complementary pipelines (also written in nextflow) for [NGS preprocessing](https://github.com/fmalmeida/ngs-preprocess) and [annotation](https://github.com/fmalmeida/bacannot) that can give the user a complete workflow for bacterial genomics analyses.

## Requirements

This pipeline has only two dependencies: [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow).

* Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc)
* Java 8 (or higher)
* Nextflow (version 20.01 or higher)
* Docker
  * Image: `fmalmeida/mpgap`

## Installation

1. If you don't have it already install Docker in your computer. Read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/).
    * You can give this [in-house script](https://github.com/fmalmeida/bioinfo/blob/master/dockerfiles/docker_install.sh) a try.
    * After installed, you need to download the required Docker image

          docker pull fmalmeida/mpgap

2. Install Nextflow (version 20.01 or higher):

       curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

3. Give it a try:

       nextflow fmalmeida/MpGAP --help

## Documentation

This pipeline is designed to accept data from Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequence platforms, being possible to perform short or long reads only assemblies as well as hybrid assemblies.

Users are encouraged to read the [complete documentation](https://mpgap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Short reads only

Short reads only assemblies can be produced with Unicycler and/or SPAdes assemblers. Since short reads have an extremely high basecall accuracy, no further steps are done. Users can use Illumina paired or/and single end reads.

Example:

        ./nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --outdir output --threads 5 --assembly_type illumina-only --try_spades
        --try_unicycler --shortreads_paired "dataset_1/sampled/illumina_R{1,2}.fastq"

### Long reads only

Long reads only assemblies can be produced with Canu, Flye and/or Unicycler assemblers. Users can assemble pacbio or nanopore reads. Addionally, users can perform a polishing step since long reads only assemblies generally suffer from basecall accuracy. For that, it is only necessary to set path to a directory containing raw nanopore FAST5 data to polish with Nanopolish or, for pacbio, to set path to \*.subreads.bam files to use VarianCaller to polish the assembly.

Example:

        ./nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --outdir output --threads 5 --assembly_type longreads-only --try_canu --try_flye --try_unicycler
        --medaka_sequencing_model r941_min_fast_g303 --nanopolish_fast5Path "dataset_1/ont/fast5_pass" --nanopolish_max_haplotypes 2000
        --genomeSize 2m --lr_type nanopore --longreads "dataset_1/ont/ont_reads.fastq"

### Hybrid

It is possible to perform two types of hybrid assemblies:

1. By using Unicycler and/or SPAdes hybrid assembly modes
  * For instance, it will use Unicycler hybrid mode which will first assemble a high quality assembly graph with Illumina data and then it will use long reads to bridge the gaps. More information about Unicycler Hybrid mode can be found [here](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler#method-hybrid-assembly).
2. By polishing a long reads only assembly with Illumina reads
  * For that, users will have to set **illumina_polish_longreads_contigs** to true. This will tell the pipeline to produce a long reads only assembly and polish it with Pilon (for unpaired reads) or with [Unicycler-polish program](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler/blob/master/docs/unicycler-polish.md) (for paired end reads)
  * Note that, **illumina_polish_longreads_contigs** parameter is an addition, when true, it will execute both strategies 1 and 2. When false, only strategy 1 will be executed.

Example:

        nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --outdir output --threads 5 --assembly_type hybrid --try_unicycler --try_flye --try_canu
        --shortreads_paired "dataset_1/sampled/illumina_R{1,2}.fastq" --shortreads_single "dataset_1/sampled/illumina_single.fastq"
        --lr_type nanopore --longreads "dataset_1/ont/ont_reads.fastq" --illumina_polish_longreads_contigs

### Using the configuration file

All parameters showed above can be, and are advised to be, set through the configuration file. When a configuration file is used the pipeline is executed as `nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP -c ./configuration-file`. Your configuration file is what will tell the pipeline which type of data you have, and which processes to execute. Therefore, it needs to be correctly configured.

To create a configuration file in your working directory:

* For Hybrid assemblies:

      nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --get_hybrid_config

* For Long reads only assemblies:

      nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --get_lreads_config

* For illumina only assemblies:

      nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --get_sreads_config
