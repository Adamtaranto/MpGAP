# MpGAP (General multi-platform genome assembly pipeline)

![](https://travis-ci.com/fmalmeida/MpGAP.svg?branch=master) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/200904121.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/200904121)


MpGAP is a nextflow docker-based pipeline that wraps up [Canu](https://github.com/marbl/canu), [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye), [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler), [Spades](https://github.com/ablab/spades), [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish), [QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast) and [Pilon](https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon).

This is an easy to use pipeline that adopts well known software for genome assembly of Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data through illumina only, long reads only or hybrid modes.

This pipeline has only two dependencies: [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow).

Checkout my other two complementary pipelines for [preprocessing NGS raw data](https://github.com/fmalmeida/NGS-preprocess) and to annotate microbial genomes.

## Documentation

### Workflow

This pipeline was design to accept data from Illumina, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequence platforms. It is possible to perform short or long reads only assemblies as well as hybrid assemblies.

### Short reads only

Short reads only assemblies can be produced with Unicycler and/or SPAdes assemblers. Since short reads have an extremely high basecall accuracy, no further steps are done.

Users can assemble Illumina paired or single end reads. [Here](https://github.com/fmalmeida/MpGAP#usage-examples) you can find a few usage examples.

### Long reads only

Long reads only asseblies can be produced with Canu, Flye and/or Unicycler assemblers. Users can assemble pacbio and nanopore reads.

Addionally, users can perform an polishing step since long reads only assemblies generally suffer from basecall accuracy. For that, it is only necessary to set path do a directory containing raw nanopore FAST5 data to polish with Nanopolish or, for pacbio, to set path to \*.bax.h5 or \*.subreads.bam files to use VarianCaller to polish the assembly.

### Hybrid

It is possible to perform two types of hybrid assemblies. The first one, is to polish a long reads only assembly with Illumina reads. For that, users will have to use the long reads only workflow (with lreads.config file), set path to Illumina reads and set illumina_polish_longreads_contigs to true. This will tell the pipeline to produce a long reads only assembly and polish it with Illumina data through Pilon.

The second one is to use the hybrid.config file (or its parameters in the command line) and set path to long reads and short reads. This, will use Unicycler hybrid mode which will first assemble a high quality assembly graph with Illumina data and then it will use long reads to bridge the gaps. More information about Unicycler Hybrid mode can be foun [here](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler#method-hybrid-assembly).

### Usage

    Usage:
    nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP [--help] [ -c nextflow.config ] [OPTIONS] [-with-report] [-with-trace] [-with-timeline]

    Comments:
    This pipeline contains a massive amount of configuration variables and its usage as CLI parameters would
    cause the command to be huge. Therefore, it is extremely recommended to use the nextflow.config configuration file in order to make
    parameterization easier and more readable.

    Creating a configuration file:
    nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP [--get_hybrid_config] [--get_lreads_config] [--get_sreads_config] [--get_yaml]

    Show command line examples:
    nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --show

    Execution Reports:
    nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP [ -c nextflow.config ] -with-report
    nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP [ -c nextflow.config ] -with-trace
    nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP [ -c nextflow.config ] -with-timeline

    OBS: These reports can also be enabled through the configuration file.

             Parameters for illumina-only mode. Can be executed by SPAdes and Unicycler assemblers.
             Users can use paired or single end reads. If both types are given at once, assemblers
             will be executed with a mix of both.

             Parameters for hybrid mode. Can be executed by spades and unicycler assemblers.

     --shortreads_paired <string>           Path to Illumina paired end reads.
     --shortreads_single <string>           Path to Illumina single end reads.

     --lr_type <string>                     Sets wich type of long reads are being used: pacbio or nanopore

             Parameters for longreads-only mode. Can be executed by canu, flye and unicycler assemblers.
             In the end, long reads only assemblies can be polished with illumina reads through pilon.

     --longreads <string>                   Path to longreads in FASTA or FASTQ formats.
     --fast5Path <string>                   Path to directory containing FAST5 files for given reads.
                                            Whenever set, the pipeline will execute a polishing step
                                            with Nanopolish. This makes the pipeline extremely SLOW!!
     --pacbio_all_baxh5_path <string>       Path to all bax.h5 files for given reads. Whenever set, the pipeline
                                            will execute a polishing step with VarianCaller.
     --pacbio_all_bam_path <string>         Path to all subreads bam files for given reads. Whenever set, the pipeline
                                            will execute a polishing step with VarianCaller.
     --genomeSize                           Canu and Flye require an estimative of genome size in order
                                            to be executed. Examples: 5.6m; 1.2g
     --lr_type <string>                     Sets wich type of long reads are being used: pacbio or nanopore
     --illumina_polish_longreads_contigs    This tells the pipeline to polish long reads only assemblies
                                            with Illumina reads through Pilon. This is another hybrid methodology.
                                            For that, users have to set path to Illumina reads through
                                            --shortreads_paired or --shortreads_single.

### Usage examples:

> Illumina-only assembly with paired end reads, using SPAdes and Unicycler assemblers. Since it will always be a pattern match, example "illumina/SRR9847694_{1,2}.fastq.gz", it MUST ALWAYS be double quoted as the example below.

    ./nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --threads 3 --outDir outputs/illumina_paired --prefix test --yaml path-to-additional_parameters.yaml --assembly_type
    illumina-only --try_unicycler --try_spades --shortreads_paired "../illumina/SRR9847694_{1,2}.fastq.gz"

> Illumina-only assembly with single end reads, using SPAdes and Unicycler assemblers. If multiple unpaired reads are given as input at once, pattern MUST be double quoted: "SRR9696*.fastq.gz"

    ./nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --threads 3 --outDir outputs/illumina_single --prefix test --yaml path-to-additional_parameters.yaml --assembly_type
    illumina-only --try_unicycler --try_spades --shortreads_single "../illumina/SRR9696*.fastq.gz"

> Long reads only with ONT reads, using Canu, Flye and Unicycler assemblers.

    ./nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --threads 3 --outDir sample_dataset/outputs/ont --run_longreads_pipeline --lreads_type nanopore --longReads sample_dataset/ont/kpneumoniae_25X.fastq --nanopore_prefix kpneumoniae_25X

> Long reads only with ONT reads, using Canu, Flye and Unicycler assemblers. With polishing (USING FAST5 data)

    ./nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --threads 3 --outDir sample_dataset/outputs/ont --run_longreads_pipeline --lreads_type nanopore --longReads sample_dataset/ont/kpneumoniae_25X.fastq --nanopore_prefix kpneumoniae_25X --fast5Path path-to-dir-containing-all-FAST5-file

## Using the configuration file

All the parameters showed above can be, and are advised to be, set through the configuration file. When a configuration file is set the pipeline is run by simply executing `nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP -c ./configuration-file`

Your configuration file is what will tell to the pipeline the type of data you have, and which processes to execute. Therefore, it needs to be correctly set up.

Create a configuration file in your working directory:

* For Hybrid assemblies:

      nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --get_hybrid_config

* For Long reads only assemblies:

      nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --get_lreads_config

* For illumina only assemblies:

      nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --get_sreads_config

* To download the YAML file used to pass additional parameters to assemblers:

      nextflow run fmalmeida/MpGAP --get_yaml
